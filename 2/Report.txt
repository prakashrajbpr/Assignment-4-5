The below observations are for the graphs that are obtained from 2nd question.


1. The blood pressure model appears reliable based on the agreement between the model and bootstrap samples.

2. Means: The average values (means) of the bootstrap samples are close to the mean of the original blood pressure model.

3. Standard Deviations: The variability (standard deviations) of the bootstrap samples are small, indicating consistency in the model's predictions.

4. 95th Percentiles: The 95th percentiles of the bootstrap samples are close to the 95th percentile of the original model, suggesting the model captures most of the data distribution.
